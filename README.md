**Project Name**: IWA_18 **Kitchen Express**

**Author**: Vuyiswa Diale

**List of Project used**: Visual Studio Code, Github

**Brief description of project**:

I was given 5 files to use, index.html, styles.css, data.js, view.js and scripts.js. I only had to work on the scrips.js file.

I had to edit the scripts.js file importing from the data.js and view.js file.

The aim was to use javascript code to make the Kitchen Express restaurant app to be able to track orders and update them according to their state.

Here are the requirements to obtain desired outcome:

* The “Add Order” button should start as focused, meaning space/enter can be pressed immediately to add an order

* Click the “?” icon should open a “Help” overlay that provides instructions on how to use the app.

* If the “Help” overlay is open, clicking the “Close” button should remove the overlay

* If any overlay is closed the focus should be returned to the “Add Order” button

* Clicking “Add Order” should open an “Add Order” overlay that allows the entering of order text and an associated table.

* Clicking “Cancel” in the “Add Order” overlay should remove the overlay without adding the information as an order.

* Clicking the “Add” button in the “Add Order” overlay should remove the overlay and add a new order to the “Ordered” column.

* If the “Add Order” overlay is closed (either with “Cancel” or “Add”) and it is opened again it should be blank (not have information from the last time it was opened).

* If an order has been added and it is clicked on the “Edit Order” overlay should appear.

* If the “Delete” button is pressed in the Edit Order overlay the overlay should be closed and the order should be removed entirely.

* If the “Cancel” button is pressed in the “Edit Order” overlay it should close the overlay without applying the changes entered into the overlay inputs

* If the “Update” button is pressed in the “Edit Order” overlay it should close the overlay and apply the changes entered to the relevant order.

* If the “Status” value is changed and “Update” is pressed in the “Edit Order” overlay then the order should be moved to the column selected in the dropdown.

* If a user clicks and holds their mouse on an order and drags it to a different column the column should highlight green to indicate it can be dropped in that column.

* If a user drops the dragged order in a new column it should be removed from the current column and added to the new column.

* Once a user drops the dragged order anywhere all highlights of columns (when dragged over) should be removed.
